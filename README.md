# For Employers
Hi, my name is Robert Cook. I'm a very passionate developer that loves to learn how to do things related to web development, art and design, and music. I am currently studying Computer Science in University and planning on graduating in 2025 with a Bachelor's degree. While a lot of my knowledge is from school, I usually self-teach myself anything I'm interested in. I'm currently looking for an internship or full-time opportunity for the summer of 2026.

# For The Average Passerby
What's up, I'm LucienZ. You may have seen me by other names (ex: LucientZ, Lucients, etc...) but the regular spelling is LucienZ (Pronounced loo-shents). A lot of the projects here have spikes in activity because I randomly get ideas and hyperfocus on completing them for about 2 weeks most of the time. If something has been developed for longer than that, then that means it's a project I truly care about.
